## Abstract
Mission
   - Object detection algorithms to speed up pattern recognition [1].
Pattern: 
   - Fiber cross-sections from 2,0003 voxel microtomography of CMC [2] samples.
Methods
   - Scientific image analysis in Python, based on unsupervised and supervised algorithms, building upon libraries such as          Skimage, Sklearn, and Keras. From Tensorflow, we use a convolutional neural network to enable the benchmark and quality        control of automated detection algorithms, also including human curated datasets (Fig II). 
Results 
   - The analysis of frequency distribution of microstructures and visualization of the materials composition; 
     Improvement of interpretability of machine learning models; 
     Ability to scan large datasets to find inconsistencies between real structures known a priori and results derived from        automated detection algorithms.

Classification Experiments available for "Evaluating Fiber Detection Models with Neural Networks" in Classification - ISVC 2019 python notebook.
